Ruby on Rails gateway for Paybox Direct French online payment services

This is pretty straightforwad and quite old stuff (2010). Nonetheless, it should still work as it did for me, for 3 years...

### Note : if you plan to use Paybox direct service for a serious usage, you may prefer a recent ActiveMerchant Gem that also implements Paybox gateway.

If you speak french, all details can be found on my blog : <a href="http://www.guillaume-barillot.com/sipsatos-et-ruby-on-rails-avec-le-plugin-atos/">my blog</a>
